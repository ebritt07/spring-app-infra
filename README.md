# ⛑️ Spring App Infra deployment 🛠️

This project securely deploys the repo: https://github.com/ebritt07/spring-app using terraform

If you'd like to fork your own version of the spring java app, and deploy to your own AWS Account here's how you can do
it:

1) Make two AWS accounts. One will be your prod env, and one will be your DEV env.
2) [Create environments in Github](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-deployments/managing-environments-for-deployment)
   named "dev" and "prod".
3) [Create an IAM role for your Github repo](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services)
   to assume when deploying. Here's an example for the **dev** AWS account connecting to your **dev** Github
   environment.
    - AWS IAM -> Create Role (type=Custom Trust policy)
    - Set the Trust policy as such:

```
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::{your_dev_account_id}:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:{your_username}/{your_repo}:environment:dev",
                    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

4) Fork this repo, and
   create [Github secret in the appropriate env](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-an-environment),
   to store the IAM role you created as  `AWS_ROLE_ARN`
    - note,
      that [role ARN's are not considered secrets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html).
      But, this project keeps it secret anyway
    - for dev environments i'd recommend giving your github iam role full AWS account admin access, then using
      monitoring tools to see what you need for prod

5) (One time only) set up your terraform backend to store state info
    - in `/terraform-backend-setup/main.tf` update to your liking:
    - update `backend.tf` to match
    - manually trigger the workflow `tf-setup-state-dev` in github actions

6) Infra project is ready for use! Check out some of the features:
    - ✅ automatically **cleans your dev environment** each day in the morning, so you don't run up a bill!
    - ✅ runs security checks to make sure you are deploying infra safely, and doesn't use any secrets authenticating
      with AWS
    - ✅ comes with a starter infra pack of an s3 bucket and a lambda trigger, if you don't want to deploy any java code
